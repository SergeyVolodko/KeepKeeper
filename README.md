In order to gradually dempnstrate implementation of Event sourcing system, the task is split on several branches-steps:
1. Basic project structure [Step 1](https://github.com/SergeyVolodko/KeepKeeper/tree/step-1)
2. Work with real Event store [Step 2](https://github.com/SergeyVolodko/KeepKeeper/tree/step-2-real-event-store)
3. Real read models (On master)

Note that
- [EventStore](https://eventstore.org/downloads/) (user name is "admin" and password is "changeit")
